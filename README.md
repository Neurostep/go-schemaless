This is an open-source, MIT-licensed implementation of a sharded database
framework inspired by Uber's Schemaless.

DISCLAIMER:

I do not work for Uber Technologies. Everything has been sourced from their
articles and video on the subject matter (which I am extremely gracious for): 

"Taking Storage for a Ride With Uber", -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg76cNaeB4s

	"Part Two", https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-part-two/ 
	"Part Three", https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-part-three/ 

The underlying sharding code is derived from github.com/dgryski/go-shardedkv

My sincere thanks to Damian Gryski for open-sourcing the above package.
