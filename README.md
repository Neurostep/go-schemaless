This is an open-source, MIT-licensed implementation of a sharded datastore
inspired by Uber's Schemaless.

I do not work for Uber Technologies (and have not ever in the past). Everything
has been sourced from their articles and video on the subject matter: 

"Taking Storage for a Ride With Uber", -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg76cNaeB4s

"Designing Schemaless, Uber Engineeringâ€™s Scalable Datastore Using MySQL"

	"Part Two", https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-part-two/ 
	"Part Three", https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-part-three/ 

The underlying sharding code is exclusively derived from github.com/dgryski/go-shardedkv
